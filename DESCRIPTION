Description: The PSMatch package helps proteomics practitioners to
    load, handle and manage Peptide Spectrum Matches. It provides
    functions to model peptide-protein relations as adjacency matrices
    and connected components, visualise these as graphs and make
    informed decision about shared peptide filtering. The package also
    provides functions to calculate and visualise MS2 fragment ions.
